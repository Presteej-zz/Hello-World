# Hello-World
Learning the Fundamentals of GitHub

Hi guys! Presteej here!

I'm delving into the world that is GitHub and collaborative OpenSource programming and thought I'd do this tutorial. Hopefully this will bring me closer to my goals of becoming a full-stack web developer for a company like Naughty Dog, Google, or Riot Games. 

It's nice to meet you guys!
